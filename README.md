## Summary

With the majority of CitiBike users being subcribers, the company can rely on 81% of its users being long-term customers, which is guaranteed revenue. This would most likely be the same for Des Moines. Most trips are taken in the most densely populated, metropolital part of New York; Des Moines is the capital of Iowa, so it is the most populated metropolitan city in the state. This means that Des Moines would be the best city in Iowa in which to launch a bikesharing program. From this analysis, Des Moines looks to be a promising place to start a CitiBike ridesharing program. Two additonal visualizations could be made to show trip starting and ending locations during morning and evening rush hour, and average trip duration by birth year and gender to see which gender utilized CitiBike ealier/later in life.
